Greetings! Welcome to my homepage! 👋 
I'm Wenlong Li (李文龙), a Master's candidate at the College of Metropolitan Transportation, Beijing University of Technology. 
My research interests include **electric bus systems**, **dynamic wireless charging (DWC)**, and **network modeling**. 
I am enthusiastic about finding optimal solutions to urban public transportation problems using mathematics and modeling techniques.

❗❗❗*Seeking a Ph.D. Position for 2025 Fall* 😍

# Research Highlight
The pollution generated by combustion engine vehicles has already caused significant harm to the environment.
To address the climate crisis and alleviate energy shortages, the electrification of urban bus systems arises as an effective policy option in the field of public transportation.
Especially, battery electric buses (BEBs) are garnering growing attention because of their merits such as cleanliness and high efficiency.
