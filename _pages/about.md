Greetings! Welcome to my homepage! üëã 
I'm Wenlong Li (ÊùéÊñáÈæô), a Master candidate at the College of Metropolitan Transportation, Beijing University of Technology. 
My research interests include **electric bus systems**, **dynamic wireless charging (DWC)**, and **network modeling**. 
I am enthusiastic about finding optimal solutions to urban public transportation problems using mathematics and modeling techniques.

# Research Highlight
The pollution generated by combustion engine vehicles has already caused significant harm to the environment.
To address the climate crisis and energy shortages, the electrification of urban bus systems arises as an option in public transportation.
Especially, battery electric buses (BEBs) are garnering growing attention because of their cleanliness and high efficiency.
However, some battery-related weaknesses, such as limited range, lengthy charging time, and high battery costs, largely arrest the development and applications of BEBs.
The emergence of <span style = "color:green">_**dynamic wireless charging (DWC)**_</span> technology is expected to resolve these problems.
Unlike fixed charging facilities, DWC facilities allow BEBs to charge in motion, thereby extending the service range of BEBs.

Nevertheless, the deployment of the <span style = "color:brown">_**charging facility**_</span> and the <span style = "color:brown">_**battery capacity**_</span> are significant variables that interdependently impact the charging scheduling of BEBs. 
Similarly, <span style = "color:brown">_**charging scheduling**_</span> for BEBs also impacts infrastructure planning.

Therefore, this study jointly addresses two optimization problems: the <span style = "color:blue">_**long-term strategic optimization problem**_</span> and the <span style = "color:orange">_**short-term tactical optimization problem**_</span>.
