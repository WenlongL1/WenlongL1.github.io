Greetings! Welcome to my homepage! 👋 
I'm Wenlong Li (李文龙), a Master's candidate at the College of Metropolitan Transportation, Beijing University of Technology. 
My research interests include **electric bus systems**, **dynamic wireless charging (DWC)**, and **network modeling**. 
I am enthusiastic about finding optimal solutions to urban public transportation problems using mathematics and modeling techniques.

# Research Highlight
The pollution generated by combustion engine vehicles has already caused significant harm to the environment.
To address the climate crisis and alleviate energy shortages, the electrification of urban bus systems arises as an effective policy option in the field of public transportation.
Especially, battery electric buses (BEBs) are garnering growing attention because of their merits such as cleanliness and high efficiency.
**However**, some battery-related weaknesses, such as **limited range**, **lengthy charging time**, and **high battery costs**, largely arrest the practical development and applications of BEBs.
The emergence of **dynamic wireless charging (DWC)** technology, which is considered a promising improvement direction for the BEB system in the future, is expected to resolve these problems.
