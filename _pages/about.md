Greetings! Welcome to my homepage! üëã 
I'm Wenlong Li (ÊùéÊñáÈæô), a Master candidate at the College of Metropolitan Transportation, Beijing University of Technology. 
My research interests include **electric bus systems**, **dynamic wireless charging (DWC)**, and **network modeling**. 
I am enthusiastic about finding optimal solutions to urban public transportation problems using mathematics and modeling techniques.

# Research Highlight
The pollution generated by combustion engine vehicles has already caused significant harm to the environment.
To address the climate crisis and alleviate energy shortages, the electrification of urban bus systems arises as an effective policy option in the field of public transportation.
Especially, battery electric buses (BEBs) are garnering growing attention because of their merits such as cleanliness and high efficiency.
However, some battery-related weaknesses, such as <span style = "color:brown">_**limited range**, **lengthy charging time**, and **high battery costs**_</span>, largely arrest the practical development and applications of BEBs.
The emergence of <span style = "color:green">_**dynamic wireless charging (DWC)**_</span> technology, which is considered a promising improvement direction for the BEB system in the future, is expected to resolve these problems.
Unlike fixed charging facilities, DWC facilities allow BEBs to charge in motion, thereby extending the service range of BEBs.


Nevertheless, the deployment of the <span style = "color:burgundy">_**charging facility**_</span> and the optimal battery capacity are significant variables, which are interdependent and directly impact the charging scheduling of BEBs. 
Similarly, charging scheduling for BEBs also impacts infrastructure planning.
Therefore, jointly optimizing the deployment of DWC facilities, the battery capacity of BEBs, and the charging schedule considering the time-of-use (TOU) tariff is crucial for applying the DWC technology in the BEB system.
